    <h1>Understanding Geopolitics in the 21st Century</h1>
    <p>
      Geopolitics in the 21st century is a dynamic field shaped by global competition,
      technological innovation, and new forms of power projection. Unlike the bipolar
      order of the Cold War, the world today faces multipolar complexities where nations
      like the U.S., China, Russia, and regional blocs such as the EU play crucial roles
      in defining global stability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Energy routes, maritime dominance, and technological superiority now define
      international power. From the South China Sea to the Arctic, geopolitical
      rivalries are increasingly connected with economic interdependence and
      ideological conflict. My project examines these evolving realities and how
      states employ strategic narratives, soft power, and economic leverage to
      achieve dominance.

      The ultimate goal of this study is to bridge academic theories with real-world
      policy implications — providing insight into how emerging powers are reshaping
      the world order through diplomacy, trade routes, and cyber influence.
